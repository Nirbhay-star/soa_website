            <h2>Civil Engineering</h2>
            <p>Civil engineering is a professional engineering discipline that deals with the design, construction, and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment, including public works such as roads, bridges, canals, dams, airports, sewage systems, pipelines, structural components of buildings, and railways. Civil engineering is the application of physical and scientific principles for solving the problems of society, and its history is linked to advances in the understanding of physics and mathematics throughout history. Civil engineers are involved in all parts of the built environment and in the protection and restoration of the natural environment. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 6.9% employment growth for civil engineers between 2021 and 2031, with an estimated 22,100 jobs expected to open up. Civil engineers are the masterminds behind bridges, tunnels, roads, dams, and water supply systems.</p>

            <h2>Mechanical Engineering</h2>
            <p>Mechanical engineering is the study of physical machines that involve force and movement. It is an engineering branch that combines engineering physics and mathematics principles with materials science to design, analyze, manufacture, and maintain mechanical systems.Mechanical engineers deal with anything that moves, from components to machines to the human body. It is one of the most diverse and versatile engineering fields, touching virtually every aspect of modern life, including the human body.</p>
